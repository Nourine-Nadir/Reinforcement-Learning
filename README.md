# Reinforcement Learning 

This repository contain all my project on the RL field. 

💭My interest for Reinforcement Learning started approximately on May 2024, after that i started my documentation for 15 days to get a convincing overview and wrote on this period [RL Overview](https://github.com/Nourine-Nadir/Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/RL%20Overview.md) on Notion that i still update today.

❤️ I liked many aspect of RL (Biomimicry, Neurology, Thinking & Acting).

🧑‍💻 Implementing different algorithms is another fun part of my journey, I began with the simpliest ones (Q-Learning, TD-Learning), then move one to more sophisticated models (DQN, DDQN, Actor-Critic, Policy-Gradient, PPO...)

🧑‍🔬 I have also tried to transpose real experiences like Tolman experiments in Ethology cognitive field.

🦿 Looking forward to implement a solution for a real robot and get it to work from scratch.
